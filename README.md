# NES-controller-input-switchboard
part of a larger homemade arcade project, i want to be able to have a embedded controller with arcade buttons and an external connector for external controllers or a light zapper, to be routed to an NES for retro games, as well as a ZimaBoard or Pi 4 (or other computer) for modern games
